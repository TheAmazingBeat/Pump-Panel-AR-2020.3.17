# Pump-Panel-AR-2020.3.17 (in development)

An AR application to provide a new experience in training firefighters to use the Fire Engine's Pump Panel. It is developed in Unity on the Lumin OS (Magic Leap One) platform.
The app is divided into two sections: **Informational** & **Simulation**.


## Informational

The app uses Magic Leap's Image Tracking technology to detect an image of a pump panel and displays a user interface that display information about each component of the panel.


## Simulation

The best way for people to learn is through engagement! The simulation allows users to be trained in using the Pump Panel without the expensive cost of water and other equipment. 
It is designed to have a fire spawn randomly in the scanned space and it is up to the user's knowledge of the pump panel to put out the fires.
